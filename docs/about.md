### GitHub

GitHub is the best place to build software together. Over 4 million people use GitHub to share code and build amazing things with friends, co-workers, classmates, and complete strangers. GitHub comes in two flavors, GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise:

#### GitHub.com

GitHub.com is a hosted (SaaS) social collaboration platform that is based on an open-source [distributed version control system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control) known as [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)). In essence, Git keeps a running log of all changes to a project. Each time you make a change, you describe that change (a commit message) and then push that change to GitHub. GitHub also allows members of the public to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary#fork) existing projects, improve upon them, and then submit their proposed changes as a "[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary#pull-request)."

GitHub offers free public repositories for open source projects as well as subscription-based private repositories for closed-source projects. If GitHub.com sounds like the right fit, [create an organization account with GitHub](/#join-the-revolution), which can include an unlimited number of individual developer accounts.

#### GitHub Enterprise

Want to run GitHub with your own datacenter? Then GitHub Enterprise is for you. Ideal for collaborating on sensitive projects or projects bound by export restrictions, GitHub Enterprise is the same GitHub.com experience, but it is packaged as a virtual appliance that you can host yourself. Many organizations that run GitHub Enterprise internally for sensitive projects also have a GitHub.com account for the projects they wish to open source to the public. [Request a free trial of GitHub Enterprise](http://enterprise.github.com) to see it for yourself.

### About the site
