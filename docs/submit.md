## Before you begin

We're looking forward to helping you tell your story. Before you begin writing, be sure to check out [the story style guide](style-guide/) which has some basic guidelines about things like style, format, and length.

## How to submit a story

### The Easy Way

Simply [open the Prose editor]({{ site.prose_server }}#github/government.github.com/new/gh-pages/_posts){: data-proofer-ignore="true"} and start typing. It's really that easy. When you're done, hit submit, and track your story's progress as it's added.

### The Manual Way

1. Navigate to [https://github.com/github/government.github.com](https://github.com/github/government.github.com) in your favorite browser, and click the "fork" button in the top right corner
2. Click the branch drop down to create a new, descriptively named branch. ![branch drop down](/assets/img/submit-branch-drop-down.png)
3. Create a new file in the `_posts` folder using the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.md`. ![new file button](/assets/img/submit-new-file.png)
4. Write your changes in the online editor. If you're new to markdown, click any white space on the page (to move your cursor out of the editor), then press the `m` key for a handy cheat sheet.
5. Add a short description of your change, and hit the big green save button.
6. Back at [https://github.com/github/government.github.com](https://github.com/github/government.github.com) click the shiny new compare button to create a new pull request. ![compare button](/assets/img/submit-compare.png)
7. Enter a title and description, and hit submit.
8. That's it! Participate in the discussion, and once a consensus has been reached, your story will be merged.
