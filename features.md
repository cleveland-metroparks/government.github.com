## Collaborate

![Collaborate](/assets/img/collaborating.png)

GitHub Issues lets you create discussion around text, proposed changes or just ideas. You can ping other users or teams (**A**), embed images (**B**) and write in Markdown.

## View

![View](/assets/img/view.png)

Visualizing data or text is lovely here. GitHub automatically creates maps (**A**) from .geoJSON files, tables (<strong>B</strong>) from .CSV, renders .markdown, shows the differences between saves of text (**C**) <em>and</em> images.

## Share

![Share](/assets/img/share.png)

GitHub makes it easy to share by generating urls for files, even for specific lines of text in a file (**A**). Forget emails and attachments, just ping another user and copy and paste a link -- we call that, the GitHub flow.

If you've got your own servers and want to run GitHub just within your agency, [GitHub Enterprise](https://enterprise.github.com){:target="_blank"} has got you covered. If you don't want to worry about servers, we'll handle that for you and [GitHub.com](https://github.com){:target="_blank"} is your choice.
