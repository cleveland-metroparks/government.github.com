Government websites often share many of the same basic requirements such as usability, accessibility, and interoperability. Rather than reinvent the wheel each time, the Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada developed the [Web Experience Toolkit](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew) to create a set of shared templates for all government websites.

After extensive user acceptance testing, this mobile-first, multilingual framework can be completely customized for any public or private use case. As project lead Paul Jackson remarked during [a recent webinar](http://www.howto.gov/training/classes/canada-web-experience-toolkit), "It actually became much easier for everyone to meet their requirements and a lot less costly by everyone pooling their resources into a common solution that everyone could repurpose." Even [the documentation itself](http://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew/index-en.html) is open source and collaborative using GitHub Pages.

Today, with nearly 300 forks, and almost 100 members, the [award-winning](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew/wiki/Accolades#wiki-Awards) Web Experience Toolkit has been translated to more than 30 languages and is one of, if not the most active government open source projects. Members of the public and government employees are encouraged to contribute code or post bug finds or fixes, questions and usability test results as [issues](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew/issues?milestone=9&state=open "Issues on GitHub for Web Experience Toolkit"). As Jackson noted, "It's all free. It's a community resources... there's no request for any funds to do any work."

Interested in using the Web Experience Toolkit for your next site? Simply [download the latest release](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew/releases). The Toolkit is [licensed for commercial re-use](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew/blob/master/License-eng.txt "Web Experience Toolkit MIT license") so it's not just for government. The toolkit is both W3C and WCAG standards-compliant and has been adapted for use with [Drupal](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-drupal), [SharePoint](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-sharepoint), [Jekyll](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-jekyll), [PHP](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-php), [SSI](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-ssi) and [Wordpress](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-wordpress).  It is fully themeable. You can see it featured, for example, on the [Canadian Open Data portal](http://www.data.gc.ca/eng), and the [conference website for a11yQC](http://a11yqc.org/ "a11yQC -- accessibility conference in Quebec"). With [over 3,000 issues under its belt](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew/issues?state=open), it's showing no signs of slowing down.
