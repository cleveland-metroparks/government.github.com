[Oakland Answers](http://answers.oaklandnet.com) is an opensource public private collaboration between [OpenOakland](http://openoakland.org/), the City of Oakland and the broader community.
It is a very simple, searchable tool to find answers to common questions- it works like google, it works on your phone and it's beautiful.

To build this, 70 people gathered from across Oakland to build a resource for the entire city as part of the National Day of Civic Hacking.

The site was built on raw code originally developed for Honolulu by [Code for America](http://www.codeforamerica.org), and forked on GitHub. From there it was implemented with help from city staff to create this new platform.

This project served a few important purposes, the main being it helped to build community awareness that residents can actually contribute to a city project, a technology project at that!

This project also demonstrated that communities and governments can together create technology and web sites that really meet the needs of the users and the managers - a subtle suggestion that procurement needs fixing..

It also provides a simple, easy to navigate system to help local businesses, immigrants, parents and nonprofit workers find the simple information they want. No complicated navigation, no departmental indexes, just simple answers.

OpenOakland will be hosting quarterly hack nights for residents and government staff to contribute new questions and answers and to work on technology improvements to this new tool.
