Cleveland Metroparks has begun to release code and data via GitHub, likely the first park district in the country to do so (although we'd be excited to be proven wrong).  The aim is to aid in building a larger ecosystem of parks-related technology to support conservation, education, and recreation in the context of public park districts.  Core to the idea is that open source, and the sharing of code and data through media for open sharing are fundamentally a public good, and a natural fit for public park districts.

So far, a few projects and datasets developed for or within the Cleveland Metroparks Park District have been released on GitHub, with more to come.

These include:

* [A bank erosion atlas](http://cleveland-metroparks.github.io/behi/), documenting erosion problems in Cleveland area streams.  The [data for the project](https://github.com/cleveland-metroparks/cleveland-metroparks.github.io/blob/master/behi/data/behi_data_10-17.geojson) is also hosted on GitHub

* [An invasive plants atlas](https://github.com/cleveland-metroparks/invasive-plants-atlas), the code for which is hosted on GitHub, though the page is not yet hosted publicly

* And a mobile and desktop trails application with a [code base named trailsforthepeople](https://github.com/cleveland-metroparks/trailsforthepeople), which allows users to find trails, picnic areas, and other amenities, with its own built in routing engine for trails and roads built on [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org)/[PostGIS](http://postgis.net)/[pgRouting](http://pgrouting.org/).
